jLinSVM
=======

A Java implementation of linear support vector machine models for regression and
classification of in-memory data sets. I needed to get myself reacquainted with
Java, which I last used two years ago, for one of my graduate classes, so I
figured this would be the perfect way to refresh myself while doing something
fun at the same time.
