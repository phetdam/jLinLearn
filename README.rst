jLinSVM
=======

A Java implementation of linear support vector machine models for regression and
classification of in-memory data sets. I needed to get myself reacquainted with
Java, which I last used two years ago, for one of my graduate classes, so I
figured this would be the perfect way to refresh myself while doing something
fun at the same time.

Although I may not be able to make significant progress during the school year,
I do intend to finish this project since it will be a nice exercise for me to
refresh my knowledge on some linear supervised learning methods.
